<p id = "p1"> Following the same drift path from the south coast Weddell Sea to 
    higher latitudes in the north, M11 also shows the same results as S59 (Fig.~\ref{temp_back}, d). On November 26, the ${\sigma}^{\circ}$ experiences the first 
    local minima (-15.28 dB) as a pre-melt phase. Within a month, on December 26, 
    the actual onset of melting becomes apparent. High temperature values above 5$^{\circ}C$, 
    could be due to poor ventilation of the sensor, as discussed in</p>
<p id = "p2"> For S61, the variation in the ${\sigma}^{\circ}$ record is qualitatively similar 
    to the other winter cases, although the temperature fluctuates several times near the melting 
    point of water. But still, 2 specific increases of ${\sigma}^{\circ}$ on October 9 and 25 can be 
    called the beginning of the pre- and melting phases. 
In summer, the daily freeze-melt cycle is not very significant compared to the other buoys, 
so ${\sigma}^{\circ}$ fluctuates around -13.5 dB with a slightly positive trend. This behaviour is 
more similar to the situation described by</p>
