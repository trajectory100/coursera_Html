      <p> For the culinary use of chickens, see Chicken as food. For other uses, see Chicken (disambiguation) and Chooks (disambiguation).
        "Cockadoodledoo" and "Cocka-doodle-doo" redirect here. For the nursery rhyme, see Cock a doodle doo.
        The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl,
        originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a
        cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a
        term only for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has
        now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English.
        In older sources common fowl or domestic fowl were typically used for this.

        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food
        until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BCE).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
        (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals,
        with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[3] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[4]
        There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[4] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia,
        and East Asia,[5] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa
        originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western
        Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BCE.[6] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BCE,
        with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to
        the annals of Thutmose III.</p>

      <h3 class="text-center"><strong>Beef</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef
        since prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.</p>

      <p>
        Most beef can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon,
        sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or
        beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, which are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle,
        are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten
        include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the
        pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine
        spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull
        (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten
        as is,[3] but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from
        younger cows (calves) is called veal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on economics, the number of
        heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher,
        is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for
        beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as
        part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation),
        where they are usually fed a ration of grain,
        protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.
        Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production
        worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[5] In absolute numbers, the United States,
        Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however,
        has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data
        from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal
        consumption per capita in the world. In comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal
        in the same year, while African countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per
        capita.

      <h3 class="text-center"><strong>Sushi</strong></h3>
      <p>
        A dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice
        for possibly months at a time, would later influence the application of rice on Japanese
        raw fish.[3] The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice, after which the rice
        was discarded. (This process can be traced back to the early domestication of rice in the neolithic
        cultures of China, and similar pickling techniques can be found among Southeast Asian, Korean, and Chinese
        rice farmers.)[4][5] The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling. When wet-field rice
        cultivation was introduced during the Yayoi period, lakes and rivers would flood during the rainy season and
        fish would get caught in the rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish and guarantee
        food for the next months, and Narezushi became an important source of protein for Japanese consumers. The term
        sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi,
        no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[6] the overall dish has a sour and
        umami or savoury taste.[7] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.</p>

      <p>
        Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"
        Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in
        the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both
        taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of
        the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity,
        causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned.
        The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries
        it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were
        pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori.
        The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or
        1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented or
        perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[8] The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it
        used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today
        as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.</p>
      <p>
        The earliest written mention of sushi in English described in the Oxford English Dictionary
        is in an 1893 book, A Japanese Interior, where it mentions sushi as "a roll of cold rice with
        fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring".[11][12] There is an earlier mention of sushi in James
        Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873,[13] and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the
        journal Notes and Queries.[14]</p>
