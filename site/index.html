<h2>introduction  </h2>
<p>Snow depth on sea ice is an essential state variable of the polar climate system and yet 
one of the least known and most difficult to characterize parameters of the Arctic and Antarctic 
sea ice systems. Here, we present a new type of autonomous platform to measure snow depth, air temperature, 
and barometric pressure on drifting Arctic and Antarctic sea ice. “Snow Buoys” are designed to withstand the harshest 
environmental conditions and to deliver high and consistent data quality with minimal impact on the surface. Our current 
dataset consists of 79 time series (47 Arctic, 32 Antarctic) since 2013, many of which cover entire seasonal cycles and 
with individual observation periods of up to 3 years. In addition to a detailed introduction of the platform 
itself, we describe the <span class= "gg">processing</span> the publicly available (near real time) data and discuss </p>

<p style="font-size: 3em;">[MUSIC] Links pretty much what makes the web what it is. In this lecture, we're going to take a look 
at different types of links and how you could create them in your HTML page.   <p class= "mo">So the first type of links</p>
that we're going to take a look at are internal links. Here I am looking at the file called links-internal.html, 
and it's located in the examples/Lecture09 folder. And here we have a couple of links we're going to take a look at. 
Now the way you create links is by specifying an a element with an attribute href. And href stands for hypertext reference.
 <p>The value of href can either be</p>The value of href can either be a relative or an absolute URL. In our case here, since we're discussing internal links 
 which are </p>

<h2>incident angle  </h2>
<p>For rough/deformed FYI, the incidence angle slope of −0.11 dB/1∘ for cross-polarization 
equates to a change of backscatter intensity of about 3 dB over the incidence angle range (19∘–46∘). 
Fig. 9 shows the backscatter intensities versus incidence angle before (black triangles) 
and after (pale circles) normalization to the reference angle for rough deformed FYI. 
The ice cover in the study area can be considered homogeneous, and, therefore, no difference 
between ascending and descending samples is made. Due to the exclusion of EW1, only angles between
 28∘ and 46∘ are shown in the figure. It can be seen
 that, as expected, the normalization levels out the trend of decreasing backscatter intensities with incidence angle.</p>
